				<h2>Montreal Canadiens</h2>
				<center><img src="./images/Canadiens.webp" class="team"></center>

				<!-- Info -->
				<p>Over the course of their history the Montreal Canadiens have won the most Stanley Cups in the league with 24, almost double that of the second place team Toronto Maple Leafs, with 13. Additionally they have had some of the most famous name play for them, including, Guy Lafleur, Maurice Richard, Jaques Plantes and Patrick Roy.</p>

				<!-- Jacques Plante -->
				<div>
					<div style="float: left">
						<img src="./images/jacques.jpg" class="team2">
					</div>
					<div>
						<br></br>
						<p class="p2">Just three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, Plante was injured when a puck off the stick of Andy Bathgate shot up and hit him in the face, breaking his nose.  He was escorted to the dressing room for stitches but soon returned wearing a home-made goaltender mask.</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>Canadiens head coach Toe Blake was unhappy about the mask but, he allowed Plante to return if he promised to discard the mask after his face healed. Plante continued to wear the mask even after his face healed and the Canadiens continued to win. After the team’s unbeaten streak ended at 18 games, Plante adhered to Blake’s request and wore nothing on his face.  Montreal lost to Detroit 3-0 that night and afterward, the mask returned.</p>
